The engines have a high bypass ratio and a low noise level, making them more fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly than the previous generation of engines. The engines also have a digital electronic engine control (DEEC) system, which monitors and adjusts the engine performance and reduces the workload for the pilots.
 
The Boeing 737-300/500 has a glass cockpit that features six cathode ray tube (CRT) displays that show flight information and system status. The cockpit also has a flight management computer (FMC) that integrates the navigation, performance, and fuel data and provides guidance for the pilots.
