Fortunately, there is a workaround that can help you install SQL Server 2000 on Windows 7 32 bit for free in just 20 minutes. This workaround involves using a virtual machine software that can create a virtual environment on your computer that mimics an older operating system such as Windows XP. By doing this, you can install and run SQL Server 2000 on the virtual machine without affecting your main Windows 7 system. In this article, we will show you how to do this step by step.
 
## Step 1: Download and Install VirtualBox
 
VirtualBox is a free and open source virtual machine software that can run on Windows, Linux, Mac OS X and other operating systems. It allows you to create and manage multiple virtual machines on your computer. You can download VirtualBox from [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). Choose the version that matches your Windows 7 system (32 bit or 64 bit) and follow the instructions to install it.
 
## Step 2: Download and Install Windows XP Mode
 
Windows XP Mode is a free feature that is available for Windows 7 users who have a valid license of Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise or Ultimate. It allows you to run applications that are compatible with Windows XP on your Windows 7 system. You can download Windows XP Mode from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8002). Choose the language that matches your Windows 7 system and follow the instructions to install it.
 
## Step 3: Create a Virtual Machine with Windows XP Mode
 
After installing Windows XP Mode, you need to create a virtual machine with it using VirtualBox. To do this, follow these steps:
 
- Open VirtualBox and click on the "New" button.
- Name your virtual machine as "SQL Server 2000" and choose "Microsoft Windows" as the type and "Windows XP (32-bit)" as the version.
- Assign some memory (RAM) to your virtual machine. The recommended amount is at least 512 MB.
- Choose "Use an existing virtual hard disk file" and click on the folder icon next to it.
- Browse to the location where you installed Windows XP Mode (usually C:\Program Files\Windows XP Mode) and select the file named "Windows XP Mode.vhd".
- Click on "Create" to finish creating your virtual machine.

## Step 4: Install SQL Server 2000 on the Virtual Machine
 
Now you are ready to install SQL Server 2000 on the virtual machine. To do this, follow these steps:

- Start your virtual machine by clicking on the "Start" button in VirtualBox.
- Wait for the virtual machine to boot up and log in with the username "XPMUser" and the password "password".
- Insert the SQL Server 2000 installation CD or mount the ISO file to your virtual machine.
- Run the setup.exe file from the CD or ISO file and follow the instructions to install SQL Server 2000.
- Choose "Typical" as the installation type and enter a name and a company name for the registration.
- Choose "Mixed Mode" as the authentication mode and enter a password for the system administrator (sa) account.
- Choose "Default" as the instance name and click on "Next".
- Wait for the installation to complete and click on "Finish".
