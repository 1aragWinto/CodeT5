- Learn the basics of the combat system. Tales of Zestiria uses a real-time battle system that allows you to move freely on the field and perform various actions, such as attacking, defending, dodging, using items, and using artes (special skills). You can also switch between different characters and fuse with seraphim to unleash powerful attacks. You can customize your battle settings, such as camera angle, target lock, and auto/manual mode, from the menu. You can also access a tutorial menu that explains the different aspects of combat in detail.
- Explore the open world. Tales of Zestiria features a vast and diverse world that you can explore at your own pace. You can find various points of interest, such as towns, dungeons, ruins, fields, and caves, where you can interact with NPCs, find treasure chests, complete side quests, and encounter enemies. You can also use your seraphic powers to manipulate the environment, such as creating bridges, melting ice, or purifying water. You can fast travel to any location you have visited before by using a save point.
- Manage your equipment and skills. Tales of Zestiria has a complex equipment system that allows you to customize your characters' stats and abilities. Each piece of equipment has a base skill and up to four bonus skills that are activated by certain conditions. You can fuse two pieces of equipment of the same type and name to create a new one with better stats and skills. You can also level up your equipment by using it in battle or by spending gald (the game's currency) at shops. You can view your equipment skills and bonus skills from the skill sheet menu.
- Collect herbs and orbs. Herbs are consumable items that permanently increase your characters' stats, such as HP, attack, defense, etc. You can find herbs scattered around the world or obtain them from certain enemies or events. Orbs are items that increase your characters' max HP and other stats depending on their type. There are two types of orbs: blessed orbs and anomalous orbs. Blessed orbs are obtained from story boss fights and also increase the max HP of enemies. Anomalous orbs are obtained from optional boss fights and only increase your max HP. You don't have to use herbs or orbs; just having them in your inventory is enough.
- Have fun with the DLCs. Tales of Zestiria 1.3 crack includes 12 DLC packs that add more content to the game. Some of the DLCs are cosmetic, such as costumes, hairstyles, attachments, and accessories for your characters. Some of the DLCs are functional, such as items, weapons, artes, and skills for your characters. Some of the DLCs are story-related, such as skits (short conversations between characters), scenarios (additional episodes that expand the plot), and dungeons (new areas with challenges and rewards). You can access most of the DLCs from the item menu or from certain locations in the game.
